# ZapDo - Your Offline-First Todo List App ðŸš€

Welcome to **ZapDo**, an offline-first todo list application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/), and [Supabase](https://supabase.io/). ZapDo allows you to manage your tasks locally and seamlessly sync them with a Supabase database when an internet connection is available. The app is modular, leveraging TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

## Features

- **Offline-First Functionality**: Use ZapDo without an internet connection. Your tasks are stored locally.
- **Seamless Syncing**: Manually sync your local tasks with Supabase when you're back online.
- **Network Status Awareness**: The app notifies you when there's no internet connection and displays a sync button when connectivity is restored.
- **Modular Architecture**: Components are separated into individual files for better maintainability and reusability.
- **Type Safety with TypeScript**: The entire codebase is written in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and easier debugging.
- **State Management with Recoil**: Manage global state efficiently with Recoil.

## Technical Overview

### Offline-First Approach

ZapDo is designed to work without an internet connection. Your tasks are stored locally using Recoil's state management. The app monitors network connectivity and alerts you when you're offline.

### State Management with Recoil

Recoil is used for global state management, providing a simple and efficient way to manage state across components.

- **Atoms**: Represent the source of truth for the state.
- **Selectors**: Derive data from atoms (not used extensively in this app).

### Syncing with Supabase

When an internet connection is available, you can sync your local tasks with a Supabase database by pressing the sync button.

- **Manual Sync**: Gives you control over when to sync data.
- **Supabase Client**: Configured in `lib/supabase.ts` for interacting with your Supabase database.

---

## Configuration

### Supabase Setup

1. **Create a Supabase Project**

   Sign in to [Supabase](https://app.supabase.io/) and create a new project.

2. **Create a `todos` Table**

   In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to the SQL editor and run the following SQL command:

   ```sql
   create table todos (
     id text primary key,
     text text not null
   );
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

**Note**: Ensure that you add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive information.

---

## Usage

- **Adding a Task**: Type your task in the input field and press the **Add** button.
- **Deleting a Task**: Press the **Delete** button next to a task to remove it.
- **Offline Notification**: A message appears when there's no internet connection.
- **Syncing Data**: When back online, press the **Sync** button to upload your local tasks to Supabase.

---

## Development

### File-Based Routing

ZapDo uses Expo's file-based routing system. You can add new screens by creating new files in the `app/` directory (if using Expo Router).

### Debugging

- **Developer Menu**: Press `j` in the terminal to open debugger.
